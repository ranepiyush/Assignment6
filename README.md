# Assignment6
>This is the _sixth assignment_ of *CS648* under *_Module 6_.*
This repository contains code written in *_Java script_* for some problem statements.
Below are the problem statemnts solved using *_Java script_*:
* **Larger or Smaller**
>Code Accepts two integer that within two separate prompts. Then, code displays only the larger of the two within the browser window. Handled the scenario where two numbers can be equal.
* **Coin Flip Game**
>A random number is generated using Math function. If number is less than 5 then it's a 'Heads' or else its a 'Tail'. User enters his choice and based on the input appropriate messages are printed using *_if else_* ladder.
* **Coin Flip Game Redux**
>For loop is used to loop 10 times and 0 or 1 is assigned to a variable randomly in each loop. If it's a 0 then it displays 'Heads' or else 'Tails'. *_For loop_* concept is used for this problem.
* **Coin Flip Streak**
>This is same as Coin Flip Game Redux, only difference is this code uses *_do while loop_* and loop is terminated when it's a tail.
* **Looping a Triangle**
>Using nested for loops code is printing a triangle of size 6*6 using *_#_* character.
* **Odd or Even**
>Code iterates from 0 to 15 using loop. For each iteration it will check if the current number is *_odd or even_*, and display a message in the console window. 
* **Marco! Polo!** 
>Code iterates from numbers 0 to 100. For each number it will do the following.:  
>If number is multiple of 3 it will display 'Marco!'
>If number is multiple of 5 it will display 'Polo!'
>If number is multiple of 3 and 5 it will diplay 'Marco! Polo!'  
* **Countdown**
>Code counts down to 0 based on the number that a user passes into a prompt. If the number is 10, it will count down from 10 to 0. If the number is 100, it should count down from 100 to 0 and so on.  

#### JavaScript concepts used:
* **For loop**
* **Do while loop**
* **Math operators**
* **Math functions: random(),round(),floor()**
* **Variable declaration and assignment**
* **Functions: alert(), document.write()**
